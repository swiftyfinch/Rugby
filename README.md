# Motivation

Why do we need some optimizations while working on huge projects with [CocoaPods](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods)?\
`-` Slow and unnecessary indexing of pods targets, which implementation we rarely try to edit;\
`-` Redundant rebuild time, probably as a result of problems, related to CocoaPods or Xcode;\
`-` Freezing UI during navigating through a project or editing it;\
`-` Broken or extremely slow autocompletion;\
`-` Noisy laptop turbines, heated aluminum, and infinite spinning pinwheel.

More in the 📖 [foundation](https://swiftyfinch.github.io/en/2021-03-09-rugby-story/) and [remastering](https://swiftyfinch.github.io/en/2023-04-22-rugby-remastered/) stories.

## Description

🏈 `Rugby` is CLI tool that was developed to solve the above problems:\
`+` Cache all pods dependencies and remove their targets from the Pods project;\
`+` Rebuild only changed pods or even download them;\
`+` Delete any unneeded targets with sources from a project and reduce its size.

## What makes it different?

🕊 Not a project dependency, just an optional step;\
🌱 Doesn't change Podfile and Podfile.lock;\
✈️ Can run [a sequence of commands from a YAML file](Docs/commands-help/plan.md);\
🕹️ Single command usage;\
🐳 Ready for [remote cache](Docs/remote-cache.md);\
🧣 Cozy log output;\
🚀 Swiftish and uses native Xcode build system.

# How to install 📦

First of all, if you have the first version `Rugby 1.x`, you need to delete it.\
Then call `where rugby` command and be sure that there are no any of paths to rugby.

### First Install

```sh
curl -Ls https://swiftyfinch.github.io/rugby/install.sh | bash
```

### Self-Update

If you already have Rugby, which version is at least `2.0.0b2`, you can use such a command.

```sh
> rugby update
```

### Full Guide

Read more in the guide [how to install](Docs/how-to-install.md) it.\
If you look for the legacy `Rugby 1.x`, visit [this page](https://github.com/swiftyfinch/Rugby/tree/1.23.0#how-to-install-).

## How to use 🏈

<details><summary>Preconditions</summary>
<p>

1. Before using Rugby you should be sure that your project source code is finalized.\
   🔸 For example: if you use `SwiftGen`, run it before calling Rugby.\
   Otherwise, your source code will be modified during building with Rugby. Then the hashes of binaries will not be suited;
2. Be sure that all your pods (including development) are ready to build standalone.\
   Otherwise, you can get a state when one of them can't be reused correctly without the source of its dependencies.\
   As a temporary workaround, you can exclude some pods like `rugby -e BadPod`.\
   🔸 For example: if some of your pods use incorrect headers.

<hr>
</p>
</details>

Then run this command in your project directory after each `pod install`.\
It will build all targets by default:
```sh
> rugby
```

Deintegrate it with the [rollback](Docs/commands-help/rollback.md) command:
```sh
> rugby rollback
```

Also, you can write a custom [plan](Docs/commands-help/plan.md) (sequence of commands).\
Use 🏈 [RugbyPlanner](https://github.com/swiftyfinch/RugbyPlanner) for visualizing changes in your project without applying them.\
For advanced usage, please read the documentation below.
