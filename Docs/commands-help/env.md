## Discussion

This command prints the Rugby environment. For example:
```yml
Rugby version: 2.3.0
Swift: 5.9
CLT: Xcode 15.0.1 (Build version 15A507)
CPU: Apple M1 (arm64)
Project: Example
Git branch: main
RUGBY_KEEP_HASH_YAMLS: NO
RUGBY_PRINT_MISSING_BINARIES: NO
RUGBY_SHARED_DIR_ROOT: /Users/swiftyfinch
```

You can find the same environment output in the head of each Rugby log file.

### Keep hash YML files

A flag to keep yaml files with target hash in the binaries folder.
```objc

```
```sh

└─ bin
   └─ Debug-iphonesimulator-arm64
      └─ 85d4367
         ├─ 85d4367.yml # Hash yml file
         └─ Alamofire.framework
```

```
```

### Set a custom path to shared folder root

A path to the root of shared folder (without `.rugby` folder name).
By default:
```objc
RUGBY_SHARED_DIR_ROOT=$HOME rugby
```
```sh
~

   ├─ bin
   └─ logs
```

You can set a different one. For example, a current directory:
```objc
RUGBY_SHARED_DIR_ROOT=`pwd` rugby
```
```sh
pwd
└─ .rugby # shared folder combined with local one
   ├─ backup
   ├─ bin
   ├─ build
   └─ logs
```
