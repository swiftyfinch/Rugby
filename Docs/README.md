## Default command

By default **Rugby** runs the `plans` command if you have `.rugby/plans.yml` file.\
Otherwise `cache` command will be run.

## Log

If you run any command without `--verbose` flag you still can get verbosity output of the last **Rugby** run:

```bash
rugby log
```

## Doctor

If you encourage any problems, please call `rugby doctor` and follow suggestions.

```bash
ðŸš‘ If you encourage any problems, please follow this checklist:
1. Firstly, update Rugby to the last version;
2. Run rugby --ignore-checksums;
3. Try to investigate build logs yourself;
4. Run rugby clean && rugby --ignore-checksums;
5. Check that Pods project builds successfully without Rugby.

Report an issue in GitHub discussions or any convenience support channel.
Attach last files from .rugby/history folder.
But be sure that there are no sensitive data.
