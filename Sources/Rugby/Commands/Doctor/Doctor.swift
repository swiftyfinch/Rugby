    üöë If you have any problems, please try these solutions.
    After each one, you need to repeat your usual workflow.

    1. Update üèà Rugby to the latest version:
       \("brew install rugby".yellow) or \("mint install rugby".yellow)
    2. Check that you're building the proper configuration.
       Sometimes projects don't have the default \("Debug".yellow) config.
       If so, you need to pass your custom config:
       \("rugby cache --config Your-Not-Debug-Config".yellow)
    2. Add ignore option \("rugby --ignore-checksums".yellow).
       Be careful, you can't pass this option to plans command this way.
       More info here: \("https://github.com/swiftyfinch/Rugby/blob/main/Docs/Plans.md".cyan).
                       (‚åò + double click on the link);
    3. Try \("rugby clean".yellow) before repeating your usual workflow;
    4. Try to clean up your \("DerivedData".yellow) and use \("rugby clean".yellow) together;
    5. Check that Pods project builds successfully without üèà Rugby.

    By the way, you can try to investigate build logs by yourself:
    \(".rugby/rugby.log".yellow)
    \(".rugby/build.log".yellow)
    \(".rugby/rawBuild.log".yellow)
    and more there \(".rugby/history".yellow)

    Report an issue in GitHub or by any convenient support channel.
    Attach last files from \(".rugby/history".yellow) folder.
    But be sure that there are \("no sensitive".red) data.
