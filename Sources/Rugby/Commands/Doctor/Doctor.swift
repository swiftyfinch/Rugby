    üöë If you have any problems, please try these solutions.
    After each one, you need to repeat your usual workflow.

    1. Update üèà Rugby to the last version:
       \("mint install swiftyfinch/rugby".yellow)
    2. Add ignore option \("rugby --ignore-checksums".yellow).
       Be careful, you can't pass this option to plans command this way;
    3. Try \("rugby clean".yellow) before repeating your usual workflow;
    4. Try to clean up your \("DerivedData".yellow) and use \("rugby clean".yellow) together;
    5. Check that Pods project builds successfully without Rugby.

    By the way, you can try to investigate build logs by yourself:
    \(".rugby/rugby.log".yellow)
    \(".rugby/build.log".yellow)
    \(".rugby/rawBuild.log".yellow)
    and more there \(".rugby/history".yellow)

    Report an issue in GitHub discussions or any convenience support channel.
    Attach last files from \(".rugby/history".yellow) folder.
    But be sure that there are \("no sensitive".red) data.
