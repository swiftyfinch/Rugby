        1. Update üèà Rugby to the latest version: \("rugby update".yellow)
           \(Links.commandsHelp("update.md"))
        2. Check that you're building the proper configuration.
           Sometimes projects don't have the default \("Debug".yellow) config.
           \("rugby cache --config Your-Not-Debug-Config".yellow)
           \(Links.commandsHelp("shortcuts/cache.md"))
        3. Add ignore option: \("rugby cache --ignore-cache".yellow).
           Be careful, you can't pass this option to plan command this way.
           \(Links.commandsHelp("shortcuts/cache.md"))
        4. Try \("rugby clear".yellow) before repeating your usual workflow.
           \(Links.commandsHelp("clear.md"))
        5. Try to clean up your \("DerivedData".yellow) and use \("rugby clear".yellow) together.
        6. Check that the Pods project builds successfully without üèà Rugby.

        By the way, you can try to investigate building logs by yourself.
        \("Last ones saved in folder: \(lastLogsPath.yellow)")

        Open an issue/discussion on GitHub or by any convenient support channel.
        Attach the last logs, but be sure that there are \("no sensitive".red) data.
        \(Links.githubIssues)
        \(Links.githubDiscussions)
        """)
